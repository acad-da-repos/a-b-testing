# A/B Testing Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will simulate an A/B test and analyze its results to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between two groups. This is a common technique used in business to test changes and make data-driven decisions.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find a function definition: `analyze_ab_test(control_group, experiment_group)`.
3.  Your task is to perform a t-test to compare the means of the two groups and determine if the difference is statistically significant (e.g., p-value < 0.05).
4.  The function should return a boolean indicating whether there is a significant difference.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   What are the assumptions of the t-test, and how can you check them?
*   Explore other statistical tests for A/B testing, such as the chi-squared test for categorical data.
*   How can you calculate the effect size of the A/B test?
